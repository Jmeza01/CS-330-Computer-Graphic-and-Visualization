### How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software in general will be making a pseudocode or flow chart that will lead me to a direction that can accomodate all requirements for the program to work. As I design software I will keep in mind all of the objects and methods that need to be used. Implementing a SDLC agile methodology and OOP model on using UML class diagrams can help me organize all the apsects of an object with attributes that come with behaviors. In fact, I would consider what will my graphical design need to be intuitive and completely functional. Therefore, I go thoroughly with the shaders that need to evolve in phases by importing my skills like shaping an object in 2D first and expanding it to be a 3D object for example.
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Some of the skills that I found really good was to leave as much comments when coding, because this way I will not run into deeper syntax errors which won't allow my rendered objects from the IDE to appear. 
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed the OOP model (Object Oriented Programming) that made it clear what are the objectives in keeping each method to its object in place. For example, I had to implement in the 3D scene texture and I had to import images that can cover all the faces of the objects to depict a real world scene.
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My tactics from the approach of my design can make a big impact in my career work in the future, by keeping the plan proposal requirements manifested when using UML diagrams like classes for objects to demonstrate what attributes are needed before developing a program. Also, the tactic is to keep a clean well-written code with inline comments in each line of code to best identify what is being used and implemented.  
### How do I approach developing programs?
First, I would apporach developing programs to see what are the requirements and what has been done previously by looking into a respository for instance of that project and looking at the history that other developers have done. Then I will consider contributing my skills and knowledge from what has been left off. 
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I learned new development strategies while I worked on my 3D scene by using OpenGL libraries that contain different methods to import them in my project. Where I had to research very much about shaping a sphere, cylinder, plane, and cube in order to render a full 3D object.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
I had to use a loop iteration factor when calling the glDrawArray for example for each frame as it is being drawn. 
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach was consistent as I evovled throughout the milestones or challenges that I had to critically think by searching for different methods in OPENGL API that has different tokens and functionalities that will render my objects into the screen.
### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science will help me reaching my future endeavours and goals to understand the most important aspect of problem solving, an essential skill for life. Students study the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business, scientific, and social contexts.
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations give a new knowledge and skills to my future educational pathway as how problem solving and critical thinking is used in creating a software program and what are the requirements in which are made for a successful software development lifecycle may impact on the proposal project.
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations give a new knowledge and skillsets to my future professional pathway as how rendering objects are made with programming code abilites and if an new objective for a future project will need of graphic visuals then I can work with other developers in a team to accomplish any image that a project manager may want to consider in the proposal project.
